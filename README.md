# adobeLogoPhoneHolder
I have recreated the worldwide famous Adobe Logo Phone Holder.

Click on the stl file entry to open it in github 3D previewer.

The openScad file is semi parametric, allowing you to chose the size of the cube and the size of the logo inside the cube.

Tweaking the logo shape would probably allow to make a model more easily printable and more robust once printed...

Here is a reduced scale print using Ninja Flex. Lots of post printing cleaning was needed (and more is still needed)
