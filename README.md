# adobeLogoPhoneHolder
I have recreated the worldwide famous Adobe Logo Phone Holder.

The openScad file is semi parametric, allowing you to chose the size of the cube and the size of the logo inside the cube.

Tweaking the logo shape would probably allow to make a model more easily printable and more robust once printed...
